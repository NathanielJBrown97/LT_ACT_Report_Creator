# ACT PDF Report Creator

## Instructions

### Folder Structure
Ensure the `main` executable is within a folder at the same level as two other folders named `SensitiveStudentData` and `StudentReports`. **Case sensitivity is important**. Your folder structure should look like this:

```
/your_project_directory
    /SensitiveStudentData
    /StudentReports
    /images
    main.exe
```

### File Placement
- **SensitiveStudentData:** All CSV files should be placed in the `SensitiveStudentData` folder. Ensure the filename format is `Results Data for Students - NAME NAME NAME.csv`. This is the default format when downloading the Google Sheet as a CSV.
- **StudentReports:** Generated PDFs will be saved in the `StudentReports` folder.

### Launching the Executable
1. **Place CSV Files:** Drop all the CSV files into the `SensitiveStudentData` folder.
2. **Run Executable:** Launch the `main` executable.
3. **Allow Terminal to Generate PDFs:** Wait for the terminal to complete the PDF generation process.

### Output Location
- **Generated PDFs:** You can find the generated PDF reports in the `StudentReports` folder.

### Important Files
- **Logo and Banner:** Ensure that `Lee Tutoring Logo classic.png` and `Linkedin Banner-01.jpg` remain in the images folder.

Follow these instructions carefully to ensure proper functioning of the ACT PDF Report Creator.
